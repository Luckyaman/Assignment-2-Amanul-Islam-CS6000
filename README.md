Journal #2 (and browsing assignment)

    Due Sunday by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a file upload

Again the journal is in latex, but this time just upload pdf of the formatted version

Part 1:  Searching:  In the video and discussion you were to find 3 particular papers.  Upload the URL (as a properly formatted latex url using the \url command)  to the pdf of the three papers, and then put a 1-2 sentence summary of your "browse" analysis and why you choose the one to scan. 

PART 2: Searching.

Uning google Scholar find at least 25 paper in your area.  Skim five of them and into your journal  a 1-2 sentence description of them, the time spent and if they are worth more time.   Then just "group cite" the remaining 20.   On the skim, Time yourself on each; aim for no more than 2 min.    Take notes on timing  (to the second.  A stopwatch app on the phone is a good choice).  

Part 3:  Browsing. 

Choose a “top” journal or conference in your field with >= 45 papers in one or two  issues from the past 2 years s.   (DO NOT search for papers with keywords.. but can search for journals/conf title and find its "contents page". 

 

 Include a screenshot of the "contents" page in your Journal and a few sentences about why you choose to browse that venue and what you hope to learn. 

 

 

Browse at least 45  (yes forty-five) papers from that issue in order. No skipping or searching for keywords.

Time yourself on each; aim for no more than 2 min.    Take notes on timing  (to the second.  A stopwatch app on the phone is a good choice). 

After the full browse,  generate a BibTeX entry for each paper, with a "note=" field that contains your timing (to the second) for your browse of that paper, and your decision to scan or trash it, and one sentence why.  Do not time making the notes.   

 

Scan 8+ papers  from the browse, and write 2-3 sentence summary, which is added to your "note" for that paper.

 

Critically & Creatively read the best  2 or 3 between the browse and search results. 

Make a latex document for Part the following sections:

A table of contents image plus why you chose that venue.

The next section in the journal should discuss your process and your learning about the process (do not discuss the content of the papers. 

The next section is your raw notes from critical/creative reads as a latex document, and include all the papers in the references. Not expecting/wanting full sentences and grammar, I want your raw notes.  If you use handwritten notes, you can take pic and include them as figures.   

 

The last section is references.. which should start with the citation for the primary conference, plus the citations for all the papers from the browse, with the timing notes.   You may have to google how to get latex to show your "notes" in your BibTeX. 

All of this should be in your overleaf or git repo as a directory; upload the pdf here.  Provide a link for me to access the latex source (shared from Overleaf is fine)
